# FoodTruck

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- San Francisco food trucks from `priv/repo/data/Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv` will be seeded, (or seed manually with `$ mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`)
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
